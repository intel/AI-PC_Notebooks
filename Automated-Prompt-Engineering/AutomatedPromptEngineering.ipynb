    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make LLMs more performant for specific tasks, prompt engineering is used to instruct LLMs to complete certain tasks. Prompt engineering is cheaper than fine-tuning, takes less data, but has often been a manual task. For LLMs that are deployed on-device, which are smaller LLMs (usually fewer than 14 billion parameters), it is even more important to have goods prompts that are optimized for the task at hand as these LLMs cannot generalize like larger LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use DSPy, an automatic prompt engineering framework to create a pipeline for a specific task and optimize the prompts for that task on Intel® AI PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is automated prompt engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic prompt engineering is a technique that takes an LLM and automatically creates better and better prompts. Any automatic prompt engineering framework requires the following:\n",
    "- LLM that needs to be prompt-engineered\n",
    "- A dataset of inputs and outputs for the task at hand\n",
    "- A metric that measures how well the LLM is doing on the task\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic prompt engineering frameworks then handle how to update the prompts to make the LLM perform better on the task. [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) is one such framework that uses signatures, modules, and optimizers to create pipelines that can then be optimized by themselves. Another framework is [EvoPrompt](https://github.com/microsoft/EvoPrompt), which uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize prompts.\n"

    "Importing everything takes a couple of seconds. The below cell outlines the most pertinent imports for this sample:\n",
    "1. `llama_cpp` is a Python package that interacts with the llama.cpp library, which is a C++ implementation that runs LLMs and other models with a focus on speed and efficiency.\n",
    "2. `dspy` is a Python package that we will use for automated prompt engineering. We will explore how it works in this notebook."
